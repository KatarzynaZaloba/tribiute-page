      <h3 id="headline">Steve Harvey’s childhood:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Steve was the youngest of five kids. His father worked tirelessly for only $5 every day. He did not grow up
          in a household of money or any sort of wealth.</li>
        <li> In school, Steve’s only goal was to be on TV. He didn’t want anything else as bad as he wanted to be a
          comedian and share his love and passion for entertainment with the world.
        </li>
        <li> One day, his teacher told him that it was impossible. A kid coming from a school in a small county of West
          Virginia didn’t have any business being on television.
        </li>
        <li> But that didn’t stop him from believing that it would happen.
        </li>

        <h3 id="headline">Homelessness to greatness</h3>
        <li> His father told him to keep the faith and believe in himself no matter what. Steve flunked out of college,
          got fired from several jobs and became homeless.
        </li>
        <strong>
          <p>
            STEVE HARVEY WAS ON HIS OWN AT AGE 27, LIVING IN HIS CAR FOR THREE YEARS.
          </p>
        </strong>
        <li> Even though his circumstances weren’t ideal, he still had this notion that he would make it one day.
        </li>
        <li> Harvey kept his faith in himself that he would have his own show and someday do what he loved.
        </li>
        <h3 id="headline">At 39 years old, Steve finally achieved his dream of being on TV</h3>
        <li> If it wasn’t for faith, how did he survive for three years in a car? He kept thinking, “God didn’t bring me
          this far to leave me.”
        </li>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>
              “I JUST KEPT HOPING BEYOND ALL ODDS THAT THIS PROCESS THAT I WAS GOING THROUGH WOULD TURN AROUND FOR ME
              ONE DAY. FAST FORWARD… I’M AT THE 10X GROWTH CONFERENCE SITTING NEXT TO MY DUDE [GRANT CARDONE].”

        <li> Today, Steve Harvey is the #1 TV personality globally, an actor, author, comedian, and show host we all
          know and love.
        </li>
        <h3 id="headline">Steve’s 10X mindset propelled his career</h3>
        <li> Steve Harvey is living proof that if you believe in yourself, you can get to where you want to go. You can
          achieve any goal you set for yourself. It may not happen now, tomorrow, next week or next month, but it will
          happen <strong>one day.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Even when your circumstances aren’t good and you have almost nothing, you have to have that deep-seated
          belief in yourself. Without it, you won’t get anywhere.
        </li>
